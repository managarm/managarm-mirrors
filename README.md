# Managarm file mirrors

This repository contains files which have, for one reason or another, been mirrored. Each mirror is contained in a seperate branch. Each mirror contains a readme file explaining the reason for the mirroring and a link to the original source of the file, and contains a LICENCE file for the mirrored file.
